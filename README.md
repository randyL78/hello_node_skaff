# Hello Node Skaff

Just a simple app to test out linking several technologies together, including:

* Node.js
* Express.js
* TypeScript
* Docker
* K8s
* Skaffold

## Getting started:

Eventually this will involve setting up Skaffold, Kubernetes, and Minikube on your
local machine. For right now, it is running like any other local Node app:

```JS
npm install
npm start
```
